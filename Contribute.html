<h2>Submitting patches<a class="headerlink" href="#submitting-patches" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>S2E welcomes contributions of code (either fixing bugs or adding new functionality).
However, we get a lot of patches, and so we have some guidelines about submitting patches.
If you follow these, you&#8217;ll help make our task of code review easier and your patch is likely to be committed faster.</p>
<p>Since S2E is based on QEMU, patch submissions mostly follow the QEMU <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.qemu.org/Contribute/SubmitAPatch">guidelines</a>
(most of the text is taken from the QEMU wiki). Here are the relevant parts applicable to S2E.</p>
<p>All contributions to S2E must be <strong>sent as pull requests</strong> on GitHub. Please create an account and create a private fork of S2E.
Patch contributions should not be posted on the mailing list, bug tracker, posted on forums, or externally hosted and linked to.</p>
<p><strong>Patches must include a Signed-off-by: line</strong>.  For more information see
<a class="reference external" href="http://git.kernel.org/?p=linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git;a=blob;f=Documentation/SubmittingPatches;h=689e2371095cc5dfea9927120009341f369159aa;hb=f6f94e2ab1b33f0082ac22d71f66385a60d8157f#l297">SubmittingPatches 1.12</a>. This is vital or we will not be able to apply your patch! Please use your real name to sign a patch (not an alias name).</p>
<p><strong>Correct English</strong> is appreciated. If you are not sure, <a class="reference external" href="http://wiki.qemu.org/Contribute/SpellCheck">codespell</a> or other programs
help finding the most common spelling mistakes in code and documentation.</p>
<p><strong>Patches should be against current git master</strong>. There&#8217;s no point submitting a patch which is based on a
released version of S2E because development will have moved on from then and it probably won&#8217;t even apply to master.</p>
<p><strong>Split up longer patches</strong> into a patch series of logical code changes.  Each change should compile and execute successfully.
For instance, don&#8217;t add a file to the makefile in patch one and then add the file itself in patch two.
(This rule is here so that people can later use tools like <a class="reference external" href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect">git bisect</a>
without hitting points in the commit history where S2E doesn&#8217;t work for reasons unrelated to the bug they&#8217;re chasing.)</p>
<p><strong>Patches that touch QEMU only</strong> should also be sent upstream. If your patch modifies QEMU and S2E, check whether the part
that changes QEMU could also be applied upstream. Split up the patch if necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t include irrelevant changes</strong>. In particular, don&#8217;t include formatting, coding style or whitespace
changes to bits of code that would otherwise not be touched by the patch.
(It&#8217;s OK to fix coding style issues in the immediate area (few lines) of the lines you&#8217;re changing.)
If you think a section of code really does need a reindent or other large-scale style fix,
submit this as a separate patch which makes no semantic changes; don&#8217;t put it in the same patch as your bug fix.</p>
<p><strong>Write a good commit message</strong>. S2E follows the usual standard for git commit messages:
the first line (which becomes the email subject line) is &#8220;single line summary of change&#8221;.
Then there is a blank line and a more detailed description of the patch, another blank and your
Signed-off-by: line. Don&#8217;t include comments like &#8220;This is a suggestion for fixing this bug&#8221;
(they can go below the &#8220;&#8212;&#8221; line in the email so they don&#8217;t go into the final commit message).</p>
